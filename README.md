# BookMyStay App

A hotel booking app that lets guests search and reserve rooms/services on a first-come, first-served basis. It manages live inventory (room types, counts, prices, amenities), enforces availability holds, processes bookings, and tracks add-on services (e.g., breakfast, airport pickup, spa). Inventory updates atomically as reservations confirm, preventing double-booking.

## Current Implementation: Use Case 6 (Booking History & Reporting)

**Purpose:**
Maintains a chronological record of all confirmed reservations using a `List<Reservation>`. This service supports generating audit reports and handles cancellation logic, effectively removing the reservation from the list and restoring the room inventory.

**Input:**
- Add to History: (Automatically added after confirmation)
- Report Request: `printBookingReport()`
- Cancel Request: `cancelReservation("D-184")`

**Output:**
```
--- [UC4 & UC6: Allocation & Booking History] ---
...
 -> Successfully allocated Room D-184 to Bob
 -> Added to History: D-184 (Bob)
